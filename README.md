#Digit Recognizer using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. Built with TensorFlow using keras, the model achieves 99% accuracy on the test set and was submitted to the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition. 

The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dense layers for improved performance. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation and zooming were used to increase model robustness. The model demonstrates high accuracy, making it ideal for digit recognition tasks.
